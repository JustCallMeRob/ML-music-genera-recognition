# MusicGeneraRecognition
This is one of my first vetures into machine learning, back when i thought 5 datapoints will be a large enough dataset to train a network. Ah simpler times. I found it lying arround on my old computer and im only posting it for the sake of prosperity. If you are looking for a working machine learning algorithm for music genera recognition, this aint it.

Idea : use images of music spectograms to train a network to recognise music genera


Application : turn the input from the microphone into a spectrogram and feed it to the trained network for the results


Results : everything is categorised as classical music
